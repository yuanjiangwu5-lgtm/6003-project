# Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models — JAX-Compatible Reproduction

This repository provides a **fully updated and JAX-compatible reproduction** of the
model extraction attack described in the CRYPTO 2020 paper:

> **Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models**  
> Nicholas Carlini, Matthew Jagielski, Ilya Mironov  
> https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04884

Compared with the original implementation, this version:

- ✔ Updates the entire codebase for **new JAX / JAXlib API compliance**  
- ✔ Makes the full extraction pipeline **runnable end-to-end** on modern Python + JAX  
- ✔ Successfully completes the extraction process for a **10-10-1 ReLU network**  
- ✔ Preserves the logic and methodology of the original CRYPTO’20 attack  
- ✔ Provides a clean starting point for further research on cryptanalytic model extraction
